Create a sample matter for Project Blackstone. This matter involves a contract dispute between two parties regarding the terms of a service agreement. The dispute centers around alleged breaches of contract, including failure to deliver services on time and non-payment for services rendered. The matter will require review of the original contract, correspondence between the parties, and any relevant documentation related to the services provided. The goal is to resolve the dispute through negotiation or, if necessary, litigation. Key stakeholders include the legal teams of both parties, project managers, and financial officers. The matter is expected to take approximately six months to resolve, with key milestones including initial discovery, mediation sessions, and potential court hearings.

# Time Entry data

For time entries in this matter, we should track the following information in addition to the standard time entry fields: - Phase of work - Category of work

# Workflows

When a new time entry is received, we should ensure that the phase and category of work are properly assigned based on the type of work being performed. Update the time entry if necessary. If insufficient information is available within the time entry to determine the appropriate phase and category, consider looking up relevant information from the document management system, or emailing the timekeeper for clarification.

When a new time entry is received, we must check whether it refers to a meeting with another timekeeper, and make sure that the durations align if so. If they are not, we should update the most recently-received entry so that the durations do match.

# Document Templates

Each billing period, we will need to issue the client with a copy of the underlying time entries. These should be sent in a beautiful HTML report including a summary table at the start listing the breakdown of costs per role of timekeeper.
Below the summary we should list the detail of all time entries, grouped by phase of work and ordered by date within each phase.
