# Progress Notes

## Session Start

Starting implementation of V3 functionality including matter/bill/time entry schemas, AI suggestions, workflows, and email services.

## Database Schemas Complete

Created 6 new schema files in packages/core/schema following Drizzle ORM patterns with proper foreign key relationships.
All schemas include timestamps, UUID primary keys, and proper cascading delete/null behaviors.
All tests pass and typecheck succeeds - schemas are ready for repository implementation.

## V3 Repositories Complete

Implemented all 6 V3 repositories following TDD pattern with curried dependency injection.
All 87 repository tests passing with full CRUD operations, query methods, and proper error handling.
Repositories exported via getRepos() and test-utils updated for easy testing.
