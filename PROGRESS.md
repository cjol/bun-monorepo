# Progress Notes

## Session Start

Starting implementation of V3 functionality including matter/bill/time entry schemas, AI suggestions, workflows, and email services.

## Database Schemas Complete

Created 6 new schema files in packages/core/schema following Drizzle ORM patterns with proper foreign key relationships.
All schemas include timestamps, UUID primary keys, and proper cascading delete/null behaviors.
All tests pass and typecheck succeeds - schemas are ready for repository implementation.
